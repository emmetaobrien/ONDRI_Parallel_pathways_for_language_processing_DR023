# Overview


This controlled data release contains data from a series of studies conducted at Baycrest Hospital concerning the role of dorsal and ventral language pathways in both brain hemispheres in language processing. The studies examined neural reactivity to semantic and syntactic anomalies in written and auditory presentation formats, although some used written presentation only.
Task-related MEG, resting-state MEG, and structural MRI data were collected from 5 cohorts of individuals: young controls (not included in the release), healthy older controls, patients with post-stroke aphasia, patients with primary progressive aphasia, and patients with AD or MCI. Speech recordings from many of the same individuals are also available on the [Dementiabank database.](https://dementia.talkbank.org/access/English/Protocol/Baycrest.html)

# Data organization

Data is organized into packages by Treatment Group (Control vs Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment, Primary Progressive Aphasia and Stroke), Imaging Scan Type, and Clinical Data Collection Domain.
